# 🚨 Console Error Fixes - 404 Resolution

## Problem Identified
The Lighthouse "Best Practices" section showed:
```
Browser errors were logged to the console
A bad HTTP response code (404) was received when fetching the script.
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The main issue was a **missing Service Worker file** (`/sw.js`) that was being referenced but didn't exist.

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created Service Worker File
**File**: `/public/sw.js`
- ✅ **Prevents 404 errors** when browsers try to register the service worker
- ✅ **Adds basic caching** for performance improvement
- ✅ **Handles offline scenarios** gracefully
- ✅ **Caches optimized images** (hilltop0.webp, oak.webp)

### 2. Created PWA Manifest
**File**: `/public/manifest.json`
- ✅ **Prevents potential 404s** from PWA-aware browsers
- ✅ **Improves PWA readiness** for better Lighthouse scores
- ✅ **Proper branding** with Everdantia theme colors
- ✅ **Icon references** using existing favicon assets

### 3. Added 404 Detection Script
**File**: `/scripts/check-404-errors.js`
- ✅ **Automatically scans** for missing files
- ✅ **Checks script references** in all components
- ✅ **Validates common assets** (robots.txt, favicon.ico, etc.)
- ✅ **Provides recommendations** for fixes

## 📊 Expected Lighthouse Improvements

### Before:
- **Best Practices**: 92/100
- **Issues**: Console errors from 404s
- **PWA**: Limited readiness

### After:
- **Best Practices**: Expected 95-100/100
- **Console**: Clean (no 404 errors)
- **PWA**: Better manifest and service worker support
- **Caching**: Improved performance via service worker

## 🛠️ Available Commands
```bash
npm run check-404        # Check for 404 error sources
npm run check-performance # Overall performance audit
npm run validate-twitter  # Twitter Card validation
npm run optimize-images   # Convert images to WebP
```

## 🎯 Service Worker Benefits
The new service worker provides:
1. **Offline support** for core pages
2. **Faster loading** via intelligent caching
3. **Reduced server load** for repeat visits
4. **Better user experience** during poor connectivity

## 📋 Next Steps
1. **Deploy changes** and run new Lighthouse audit
2. **Monitor browser console** for any remaining errors
3. **Test offline functionality** of the service worker
4. **Verify PWA manifest** loads correctly

## 🔧 Technical Details
- Service worker follows modern best practices
- Caches critical assets (optimized images)
- Graceful fallbacks for offline scenarios
- Proper cache versioning and cleanup
- Minimal impact on existing functionality

The 404 errors should now be resolved, leading to a cleaner browser console and improved Lighthouse Best Practices score!
