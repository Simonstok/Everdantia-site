# DEPLOYMENT FIXES - August 19, 2025

## Issues Identified

1. **CSS MIME Type Error**
   - Error: `Refused to apply style from 'https://everdantia.art/_astro/index.CohWf-vu.css' because its MIME type ('text/html') is not a supported stylesheet MIME type`
   - Cause: Server-side rendering configuration was causing CSS files to be served with incorrect MIME type

2. **Missing Responsive Images**
   - Error: `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 () hilltop0-1920.webp`
   - Cause: Homepage references responsive image variants that weren't generated

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Astro Configuration Fix
- **File**: `astro.config.mjs`
- **Change**: Changed from `output: 'server'` with Netlify adapter to `output: 'static'`
- **Reason**: Static generation ensures proper MIME types for assets and better performance

### 2. Netlify Headers Configuration
- **File**: `public/_headers`
- **Added**: Explicit MIME type headers for CSS, JS, and image files
- **Security**: Added security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)
- **Caching**: Optimized cache headers for static assets

### 3. Enhanced Redirects
- **File**: `public/_redirects`
- **Added**: Security headers in redirects configuration
- **Maintained**: WWW to non-WWW redirect

### 4. Responsive Images Creation
- **Created missing image variants**:
  - `hilltop0-1920.webp` (hero background)
  - `hilltop0-small.webp`, `hilltop0-medium.webp`
  - Tree images: `14-small.webp`, `14-medium.webp`, `74-small.webp`, `74-medium.webp`, `100-small.webp`, `100-medium.webp`
  - Corresponding JPG fallbacks for all variants

## Expected Results

1. ✅ **CSS files will load correctly** with proper `text/css` MIME type
2. ✅ **All responsive images will be available** (no more 404 errors)
3. ✅ **Better security** with proper headers
4. ✅ **Improved performance** with static generation and optimized caching
5. ✅ **Cross-browser compatibility** maintained

## Deployment Notes

- Site is now configured for static generation
- All assets have proper MIME types and security headers
- Missing responsive images have been created
- Search functionality will still work with client-side API calls

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the changes and verify the console errors are resolved
2. Test the search functionality works correctly with static generation
3. Continue with roadmap priorities (Terms/Privacy pages, dark mode toggle)
