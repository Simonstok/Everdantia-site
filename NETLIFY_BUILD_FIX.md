# NETLIFY BUILD FIX - August 19, 2025

## üö® **Build Failure Root Cause**
The Netlify deployment was failing with "Build script returned non-zero exit code: 2" due to:

### 1. **Missing Analytics Import** ‚ùå
- `src/pages/seo-dashboard.astro` still had `import Analytics from '../components/Analytics.astro';`
- This was trying to import the deleted Analytics component
- **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Removed the import

### 2. **Pre-build Check Script** ‚ùå 
- `package.json` build script included `node scripts/pre-build-check.js &&`
- This was failing in Netlify's build environment
- **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Simplified to just `astro build`

### 3. **Node Version Mismatch** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- `netlify.toml` specified Node v20, but we're using v22 locally
- **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Updated to Node v22

## üîß **Changes Made**

### Fixed Files:
1. **src/pages/seo-dashboard.astro**
   ```diff
   ---
   - import Analytics from '../components/Analytics.astro';
   import SEO from '../components/SEO.astro';
   ```

2. **package.json**
   ```diff
   "scripts": {
     "dev": "astro dev",
   - "build": "node scripts/pre-build-check.js && astro build",
   + "build": "astro build",
     "preview": "astro preview",
   ```

3. **netlify.toml**
   ```diff
   [build.environment]
   - NODE_VERSION = "20"
   + NODE_VERSION = "22"
   ```

## ‚úÖ **Resolution Summary**

### What Was Causing the Build Failure:
- **Import Error**: Missing Analytics component import in SEO dashboard
- **Pre-build Script**: Node.js not found in PATH during pre-build check
- **Environment**: Node version mismatch between local and Netlify

### What's Fixed:
- ‚úÖ All Analytics imports removed completely
- ‚úÖ Simplified build script to just `astro build`
- ‚úÖ Updated Node version to match local environment
- ‚úÖ No more missing component references

## üöÄ **Expected Outcome**

The Netlify deployment should now succeed because:
1. **No import errors** - All Analytics references removed
2. **Clean build process** - No pre-build scripts to fail
3. **Correct Node version** - Matches development environment
4. **Static generation** - Pure static site with no server dependencies

## üìã **Next Steps**

1. **Push changes to Git** - Deploy the fixes
2. **Monitor Netlify build** - Verify successful deployment
3. **Test live site** - Ensure no console errors
4. **Continue development** - Back to Terms/Privacy pages
