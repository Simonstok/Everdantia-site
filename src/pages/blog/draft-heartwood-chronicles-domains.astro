			<h1>The Heartwood Chronicles: The Domains of Everdantia</h1>
			<p class="post-intro">Six realms within a world, each holding its own character and calling. From the ancient roots of Forest to the ethereal glow of Aurora Canopy, discover the living Domains that define Everdantia.</p>
		</header>

		<section class="intro-section">
			<p>In Everdantia, nature is not just scenery ‚Äî it is story. Every tree draws its essence not only from soil and sunlight, but from the Domain it calls home. Six Domains shape this living world, each a distinct realm with its own rhythm, its own mysteries, and its own gifts to offer those who understand them.</p>
			<p>To know the Domains is to know the soul of Everdantia itself. Whether you seek the timeless wisdom of ancient groves or the rare wonder of auroral skies, each Domain offers a different path to connection with the natural world.</p>

			</div>
			<h2>üå≥ Forest ‚Äî The Verdant Haven</h2>
			<p>The forest is the oldest and most abundant Domain in Everdantia. Here, towering trunks rise shoulder to shoulder, their branches weaving into vast canopies that let only golden shafts of sunlight break through. The air is thick with the scent of moss and rich earth, alive with the rustle of hidden creatures. Beneath this endless green, time feels slower, measured not by hours but by seasons.</p>
			<p>The Verdant Haven is a sanctuary of resilience. Within its shadows, countless generations have grown, fallen, and grown again. Legends speak of wanderers who entered the forest and found themselves in a place where centuries could pass in the blink of an eye. To dwell here is to become part of Everdantia's deepest rhythm ‚Äî enduring, breathing, and eternal.</p>

			</div>
			<h2>‚õ∞Ô∏è Hilltop ‚Äî The Windswept Peaks</h2>
			<p>High above the valleys, where the air grows thin and the wind never stops singing, lies the Hilltop Domain. Here, trees must be strong to survive. Their roots dig deep into rocky soil, their branches bend but do not break. The view from these heights stretches endlessly ‚Äî a tapestry of all the other Domains spread below like a living map.</p>
			<p>The Windswept Peaks are places of clarity and vision. Those who climb here often speak of revelations that come with altitude ‚Äî insights that only emerge when you can see the whole of the world laid out beneath you. The trees of this Domain are hardy, weathered, and wise.</p>

			</div>
			<h2>üåø Clearing ‚Äî The Quiet Grove</h2>
			<p>Between the depth of forests and the openness of meadows lies the Clearing Domain ‚Äî a place of harmony and stillness. Here, the sunlight falls unbroken, bathing grasses and wildflowers in warmth. Forest edges frame the space like watchful guardians, but within, peace reigns.</p>
			<p>Clearings have long been considered sacred in Everdantia. They are natural gathering places, chosen by clans and wanderers alike when truth must be spoken. The air in a clearing feels expectant, as though the world itself leans closer to listen. Those who step into the Quiet Grove often describe a strange calm, as though their burdens grow lighter in the open light.</p>

			</div>
			<h2>üåå Night Sky ‚Äî The Celestial Veil</h2>
			<p>The Night Sky Domain is where the heavens unfold in their full majesty. Countless stars scatter like runes across the darkness, their constellations shifting with the passage of ages. Moonlight silvers the land below, and sometimes, faint nebulae ripple in the distance, painting the night in soft hues of violet and blue.</p>
			<p>Those who walk beneath the Celestial Veil speak of awe and humility. To stand here is to feel the smallness of one's being and yet the immensity of connection. Lorekeepers say that the trees and stones of this Domain drink starlight, storing it in silence until the right moment comes to release it.</p>

			</div>
			<h2>üèõ Ancient Ruins ‚Äî The Memory Keepers</h2>
			<p>In Everdantia, not all places are untouched by time. The Ruins Domain lies where civilizations once thrived and have long since fallen, their remnants now entwined with moss, ivy, and silence. Crumbling arches and weathered columns rise like bones from the earth, their carvings eroded but not forgotten.</p>
			<p>The Memory Keepers are not mournful, but steadfast. Here, stone and root grow together, sharing the patience of centuries. Travelers who linger among the ruins often feel the press of history ‚Äî the weight of lives once lived, of knowledge once held.</p>

				   </picture>
			</div>
			<h2>‚ú® Aurora Canopy ‚Äî The Dreamlit Realm</h2>
			<p>The rarest of all Domains, the Aurora Canopy transforms the night sky into a living river of light. Curtains of emerald, violet, and gold ripple endlessly, drifting like celestial banners that fold and unfold as though the heavens themselves are breathing.</p>
			<p>Beneath this shifting glow, the land is bathed in color, each stone and blade of grass touched by magic. Lorekeepers claim that the auroras are not just beauty, but messages ‚Äî fragments of memory from beyond Everdantia, carried on the currents of the cosmos.</p>

		<section class="closing-section">
			<h2>üåø The Living Realms of Everdantia</h2>
			<p>The Domains of Everdantia are more than settings ‚Äî they are living sanctuaries where the land itself breathes with myth. To hold a tree is to hold not only its lineage, but the world it has chosen to root in. Whether among the timeless Forest, the windswept Hilltop, the sacred Clearing, the starlit Night Sky, the silent Ruins, or the rare Aurora Canopy, each Domain invites you to step inside its story.</p>
			<p>Which Domain calls to you? In Everdantia, every choice becomes part of the story ‚Äî and every story becomes part of the living world.</p>
