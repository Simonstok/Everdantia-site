  <p>In Everdantia, we’re not only growing art — we’re growing trust.</p>
  <p>While the first trees in our digital valley take shape, we’re working on something just as important: making sure every sale is tied to real-world ecological restoration.</p>
  <p>Our long-term model sets aside 20% of every mint’s net proceeds for rewilding. But for our Genesis Trees mint, we’re going further — 50% of net proceeds will go directly to our first nature partner. Every step will be recorded in our public Forest Ledger, where you’ll be able to see each transaction, proof of donation, and — most rewarding of all — photos and GPS coordinates of new trees or protected land.</p>
  <p>Before we can make that first donation, we want to ensure we’re partnering with the right people. That’s why, over the coming weeks, we’re speaking with local reforestation initiatives and international conservation NGOs alike. We’re looking not only at their mission, but also their transparency, track record, and tangible impact in the field.</p>
  <p>This isn’t a race to put the first logo on our site. It’s a careful search — so that every Keeper of Balance knows: the seed they plant in Everdantia will take root beyond the screen.</p>
  <p>In the weeks ahead, we’ll share more about the conversations, choices, and first entries in our Forest Ledger. This is how Everdantia grows — with care, and together with you.</p>
