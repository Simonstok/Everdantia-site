  <p>In Everdantia, weâ€™re not only growing art â€” weâ€™re growing trust.</p>
  <p>While the first trees in our digital valley take shape, weâ€™re working on something just as important: making sure every sale is tied to real-world ecological restoration.</p>
  <p>Our long-term model sets aside 20% of every mintâ€™s net proceeds for rewilding. But for our Genesis Trees mint, weâ€™re going further â€” 50% of net proceeds will go directly to our first nature partner. Every step will be recorded in our public Forest Ledger, where youâ€™ll be able to see each transaction, proof of donation, and â€” most rewarding of all â€” photos and GPS coordinates of new trees or protected land.</p>
  <p>Before we can make that first donation, we want to ensure weâ€™re partnering with the right people. Thatâ€™s why, over the coming weeks, weâ€™re speaking with local reforestation initiatives and international conservation NGOs alike. Weâ€™re looking not only at their mission, but also their transparency, track record, and tangible impact in the field.</p>
  <p>This isnâ€™t a race to put the first logo on our site. Itâ€™s a careful search â€” so that every Keeper of Balance knows: the seed they plant in Everdantia will take root beyond the screen.</p>
  <p>In the weeks ahead, weâ€™ll share more about the conversations, choices, and first entries in our Forest Ledger. This is how Everdantia grows â€” with care, and together with you.</p>
