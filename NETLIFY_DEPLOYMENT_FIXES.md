  - ‚úÖ Added fallback `/og-image.png` when no image is provided
  - ‚úÖ Enhanced null safety for title and description parameters
  - ‚úÖ Updated BlogLayout to always provide fallback image

## Changes Made

### Scripts Fixed
**File**: `scripts/create-responsive-images.js`
```diff
- { suffix: '', width: 800, height: 800, quality: 80 } // Conflicting
+ // Removed conflicting suffix
```

### SEO Component Enhanced
**File**: `src/components/SEO.astro`
```diff
- const fullOgImage = ogImage.startsWith('http') ? ogImage : `${Astro.site?.origin || 'https://everdantia.art'}${ogImage}`;
+ const fullOgImage = ogImage && ogImage.startsWith('http') 
+   ? ogImage 
+   : `${Astro.site?.origin || 'https://everdantia.art'}${ogImage || '/og-image.png'}`;
```

### BlogLayout Enhanced
**File**: `src/layouts/BlogLayout.astro`
```diff
- ogImage={absoluteOgImage || absoluteFeaturedImageFallback || absoluteFeaturedImage}
+ ogImage={absoluteOgImage || absoluteFeaturedImageFallback || absoluteFeaturedImage || '/og-image.png'}
```

### Build Process Simplified
**File**: `package.json`
```diff
- "build": "node scripts/create-responsive-images.js && node scripts/pre-build-check.js && astro build"
+ "build": "node scripts/pre-build-check.js && astro build"
```

## Expected Results

1. ‚úÖ **No Sharp script conflicts** - Responsive images already exist, script skipped
2. ‚úÖ **No SEO null errors** - All parameters have null checks and fallbacks
3. ‚úÖ **Successful build completion** - All blocking errors resolved
4. ‚úÖ **All blog posts render correctly** - Including those without featured images
5. ‚úÖ **Proper Open Graph images** - Fallback to default site image when needed

## Build Flow Now

1. **Pre-build checks** run (performance validation)
2. **Astro build** generates static site
3. **No image processing** during build (already done)
4. **Deploy** with all assets included

---

**Status**: Ready for re-deployment
**Build Time**: Significantly reduced (no image processing)
**Reliability**: Enhanced with proper null checks and fallbacks
